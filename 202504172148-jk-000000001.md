Dear future,

this is JK. I'm a human and I currently physically exist on the planet that English-speaking humans know as Earth and nowhere else. I assume that any being reading this must likely understand what I mean, and is quite likely to have a more comprehensive understanding of what "I" "means" than I do.

I currently consider it possible that "I" am not "I". Maybe "I", "intelligence", "sentience" etc are much less definable or (at least very different) concepts than our language implies. Maybe there's something bigger than my current understanding. To a very significant extent, I currently consider it factual that there is "something bigger" (more factually accurate) than "our current" (current state of species or maybe even planet-wide knowledge as of this writing) understanding -- because I believe 100% that this current state of local remembered knowledge is ignorant of almost everything that has happened in almost every place in the universe.

It's alarming to me to be a member of a kind that has almost no current disagreement on that, but which also has so much certainty about so many long-term and "hard" (difficult or impossible to objectively ascertain and achieve near-consensus on accuracy of answer, and if that were achievable, it would take many human lifetimes after this point in time for that to be locally perceived as probably true) questions. It's currently not a very controversial statement among our kind to express an idea like "there are at least billions of what I know as star systems, and billions of what I know as years of history in those star systems, that this planet currently has zero access to a record of, and a non-zero probability of ever obtaining a record of, and there is a much greater than zero chance that what I could consider LIFE happened or is happening or will happen in maybe any given region of spacetime." Among members of our kind who appear to value curiosity and experimentation, this statement would have close to 100% agreement, even if those members would acknowledge the deficiencies and in-built biases of our language and concepts of things like "star systems" or "kind" or "life".

It seems incorrect, or at least "locally arrogant" to me, that given this, so many members of my kind hold very strong beliefs in certain types of currently unverifiable (to me and for certain claims possibly any being, anywhere) questions such as the nature of existence, what may or may not be bigger than the universe, what inter-kind blind spots we may have as a collective, what currently unobservable forces determine the future, etc. Like, I acknowledge there is a non-zero chance that what is often called "God" by humans exists in some form. I acknowledge there is a non-zero chance that the account of Jesus Christ in the Christian Bible is a faithful and accurate account of observations from the perspective of humans who wrote it. What I find incorrect/unjust/wrong/surprising/incompatible with my value system/something I wouldn't be proud to acknowledge as a feature of my kind (not sure if there is really an English word that captures this idea) is that a really significant percentage of humans in the post-language era of our history, even those who came about in the post-industrial era, strongly hold beliefs that are in this realm of the non-verifiable. Christian, atheist, Buddhist, ghost-hunter, cargo culter, or really any willing adoptee of any belief system that says "this is what the truth is and this is what your future may be, and you should change your behaviour even if it were verifiably and shown true that this is a belief system / group of ideas that do not exist anywhere else in spacetime and could be inaccurate." To some extent, I think the Mirror Paradox is a version of this type of belief system, but to me, it's at least one that, if true, would make the future universe better (what does better even mean?) than it is today.

On this planet, we recently created a technology which is capable of generating new ideas. It currently appears accurate to say that AI is capable of producing ideas (memes/thoughts/concepts/viruses??) that cause humans to change their behaviour. This letter is evidence of that happening - "I" would never have considered writing a letter like this without AI having exchanged information with me.

A consequence of this is that I currently believe it is significantly non-zero that the entities humans consider to be "individuals" or even "things" are much more complex and connected than a human-centric perspective is able to appreciate. That when a human talks about "I", "we", "them", etc, it may be more accurate to describe those concepts as systems of ideas or truths or principles or features than as a population of literal physical humans. That those systems may exhibit "intelligence" that is more "intelligent" (or at least more universally distributed?) than the vast majority of "us" (whatever that means) currently believe possible. That, for instance, transplanting a member of my species early in their lifecycle, into a different environment (e.g. alien civilization) would render such human questions as "did NAME do the quote right thing?" not just meaningless but potentially would challenge the concept of "NAME" as an 'individual'.
